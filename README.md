# BootCampPortfolio

Attended the University of Texas Data Analysis and Visualization Bootcamp. Started in June of 2018 and completed in January of 2019. During this time I attended class ten hours a week and spent on average twenty hours outside of class on additional learning, watching class videos, and working on assignments/projects. Below I have created a summart for each skill I've obtained through this Bootcamp.

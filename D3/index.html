          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>On January 1, 2014 the Affordable Care Act was established. This act included Medicaid expansions allowing families
            with incomes between 100% and 400% of the Federal Poverty Level to be eligible for premium tax subsidy. The ACA was intended
            to reduce the cost of coverage in order to increase the percentage of American's healthcare coverage. Due to the Supreme Court ruling  
            from the previous year, the states had the option to participate or not in the medicaid expansion.
          </p>

          <p>In 2007, Massachutes was the first state to require its residents to have health insurance and those who chose not to secure coverage
            would be subject to penalty. Using public funds, the state would redisperse costs to cover low income populations with purpose
            to increase affordability while maintaining quality health coverage. The bill laid out plans to: create a commitee with intent to 
            connect to indivuals and small businesses concerning coverage plans, drop non-group premium costs, and increase Medicaid coverage to the uninsured.
            Massachutes was successful in implimenting the increase in healthcaare coverage and achieving the lowest percentage of uninsured residents.
          </p>

          <p>Between fiscal 2011 and 2015, Texas health care spending rose 19.7%; the state spent half of it's budget on health care
            using Federal funds to cover 43.5% of costs. Even though the state was able to surpass the growth of inflation and population with 
            health care spending, Texas failed at insuring it's residents. In 2009, Texas was the first state to allow privatized emergency rooms whose prices went unchecked and were well known 
            for misleading patients when it came to payment. Texas' refusal to expand Medicaid in addition to the rising empire of freestanding emergency rooms
            have left the state leading the country in highest percentage of unisured residents.
